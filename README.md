# LayerHopper
Allows easy and automatic layer hopping within guild in WoW Classic. This addon will only exchange the layer ids and not "layer 1" or "layer 2". If you want to know if you are on layer 1 or 2 please use https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nova-world-buffs in conjunction with this addon.

Currently only works to know your current layer when you target any NPC in Orgrimmar/Stormwind.

How to use the addon: left clicking the minimap icon will request layer switch and /lh will open settings
